// Game of Life for the 4x4x4 and 8x8x8 led cube

// Original rules:
// live cells:
//  fewer than two neighbour: die
//  two or three neighbours: live
//  more than three neighbours: die
// dead cells:
//  exactly three live neighbours becomes alive

// This is 3d space, so the cell can have life on two more sides.
// We have to tweak the rules a bit to make it work:

// Create life in a dead cell if neighbours == 4
